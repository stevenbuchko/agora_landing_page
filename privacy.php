        </div>

                <p>1.1 AO is committed to maintaining the confidentiality, integrity and security of any personal information provided to us by our users. Accordingly, this Privacy & Security Policy explains how we use and protect any personal information you may provide to us in connection with the services we provide either through our website, located at www.agoraorg.com (the "AO Site"), or through our mobile application, which we refer to as the “AGORA ORGANIZATIONS Platform” (“the AOP”), both of which are owned and operated by AGORA ORGANIZATIONS, LLC. </p>
                <p>1.2 By using the AOP, you agree that you have reviewed, understood and agreed with the AO Terms and Conditions, (the “AOT&C”), including this Privacy and Security Policy, which should be treated as integrated with the AOT&C, as they may be amended from time to time, as outlined in "Change to this Policy" below.</p>
                <p>1.3 "Personal information" for purposes of this Policy means information that identifies you or is otherwise uniquely associated with you, such as your name, address, phone number, or email address.</p>
                <p>1.4 AO stresses its privacy and security standards to guard against identity theft and provide security for your personal information. We regularly re-evaluate our privacy and security policies and adapt them as necessary to deal with any new challenges as they arise.</p>

        <div class="title-area">
            <h3 class="subhead">2.0 Personal Information Collected</h3>
        </div>
                <p>2.1 In providing the Services, we may need to collect some or all of the following personal information from you:</p>
                <p>    - Contact Information including your name, email address, mailing address, and/or phone number</p>
                <p>    - Billing Information such as credit card number, and billing address</p>

                <p>2.2 Demographic Information.  For the avoidance of doubt, by using the AOP, you are agreeing that we can also use, at our discretion, Demographic Information not uniquely identifiable to you, such as age, education, gender, interests, zip code and the like to allow us to optimize our Services based on the collective demographics harvestable from our subscribers, such as you.</p>

                <p>2.3 When you download and use our Services, we automatically collect information on the type of device you use, operating system version, and the device identifier (or "UDID").</p>

        </div>

                <p>3.1 We do not and will not sell or rent your personal information to anyone, for any reason, at any time. AO uses and discloses your personal information only as follows:</p>

                <p>    - to analyze site usage and improve the Service;</p>
                <p>    - to deliver to you any administrative notices, money alerts and communications relevant to your use of the Service;</p>
                <p>    - to fulfill your requests for certain products and services;</p>
                <p>    - for market research, project planning, troubleshooting problems, detecting and protecting against error, fraud or other criminal activity;</p>
                <p>    - to third-party contractors that provide services to AO and are bound by these same privacy restrictions;</p>
                <p>    - to enforce the AOT&C, including this Privacy and Security Policy.</p>

                <p>3.2 AO may, from time to time, offer promotions with various businesses, websites, mobile applications or third parties. Each such promotion will be subject to and governed by the AOT&C, including this Privacy and Security Policy and any applicable rules or terms we may post online, including within e-mail or other communications with you. To the extent you elect to participate in any such promotion, we may share personal information, such as name, e-mail address, and other related information with the applicable third party for the limited purpose of allowing them to make the promotion available and track participation within such promotion.</p>

                <p>3.3 We may also disclose your personal information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or similar legal process, or when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request.  We shall endeavor to limit any such disclosure to the minimum extent possible within the limits of the law.</p>

                <p>3.4 If AO is involved in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will be notified via email and/or a prominent notice on our Web site of any change in ownership and any choices you may have regarding your personal information in the event such merger, acquisition or sale occurs.</p>

        <div class="title-area">
            <h3 class="subhead">4.0 User Access and Choice</h3>
        </div>

                <p>4.1 If the personal information on file for you changes, or if you no longer desire to use our Services, you may correct, update, amend, delete/remove, or deactivate such information by making the change on our Member Information page or by emailing AO Customer Support.</p>

                <p>4.2 We will retain your personal information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide our Services to you. We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements.</p>

                <p>4.3 If you wish to subscribe to our newsletter(s), we will use your name and email address to send the newsletter to you. Out of respect for your privacy, you may choose to stop receiving our newsletter or marketing emails by following the unsubscribe instructions included in these emails, accessing the email preferences in your account settings page or you can contact us directly as provided below.</p>

        <div class="title-area">
            <h3 class="subhead">5.0 Cookies / Tracking Technologies</h3>
        </div>

                <p>5.1 A cookie is a small text file that is stored on a user’s computer for record-keeping purposes. We use cookies on this site. We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site.</p>

                <p>5.2 We use both session ID cookies and persistent cookies. A session ID cookie expires when you close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive for an extended period of time. You can remove persistent cookies by following directions provided in your Internet browser’s “help” directory.</p>

                <p>5.3 If you reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your ability to use some areas of our site, such as contests or surveys, may be limited.</p>

                <p>5.4 The use of cookies by our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, or service providers is not covered by this Privacy and Security Policy. We do not have access or control over such cookies. Our partners, affiliates, tracking utility company, and service providers use session ID cookies to make it easier for you to navigate our site.</p>

                <p>5.5 We employ [or our third party advertising partner(s) may employ] a software technology called clear gifs (a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs), that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective. Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies, and are used to track the online movements of Web users. In contrast to cookies, which are stored on a user’s computer hard drive, clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. We do not tie the information gathered by clear gifs to our customers’ personally identifiable information.</p>

        <div class="title-area">
            <h3 class="subhead">6.0 Security</h3>
        </div>

                <p>6.1 The security of your Personal Information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information, such as a credit card number or financial information, on our forms, we encrypt the transmission of that information using secure socket layer technology (SSL).</p>

                <p>6.0 We follow generally accepted standards to protect the Personal Information submitted to us, both during transmission and once we receive it.  By using the AOP, you acknowledge that notwithstanding AO’s reasonable efforts to maintain the privacy and security of your Personal Information, no method of information transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, can reasonably be expected to be 100% secure. Therefore, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of the Personal Information. If you have any questions about security on our Web site, please contact us.</p>

        <div class="title-area">
            <h3 class="subhead">7.0 Changes to this Policy</h3>
        </div>
                <p>7.1 AO may update this Privacy and Security Policy from time to time to reflect changes to our information practices. If we make any material changes, we will notify you by email or by means of a notice on the AO Site prior to the change becoming effective. We encourage you to periodically review the page on the AO Site for the latest information on any material changes to our Privacy and Security Policy.  Your continued use of the AOP indicates your consent and agreement with our Privacy and Security Policies.</p>
